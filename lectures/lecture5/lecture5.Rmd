```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
#Use this if you want TOC to show level 2 headings
\tableofcontents
#Use this if you don't want TOC to show level 2 headings
\tableofcontents[subsectionstyle=hide/hide/hide]
```

### Libraries we will use today

"Load" the package we will use today (output omitted)

- __you must run this code chunk after installing these packages__
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(haven)
library(labelled)
```
__If package not yet installed__, then must install before you load. Install in "console" rather than .Rmd file

- Generic syntax: `install.packages("package_name")`
- Install "tidyverse": `install.packages("tidyverse")`

Note: when we load package, name of package is not in quotes; but when we install package, name of package is in quotes:

- `install.packages("tidyverse")`
- `library(tidyverse)`

# Augmented vectors

### Data we will use to introduce augmented vectors

```{r}
rm(list = ls()) # remove all objects

#load("../../data/prospect_list/western_washington_college_board_list.RData")
load(url("https://github.com/ozanj/rclass/raw/master/data/prospect_list/wwlist_merged.RData"))

```

## Review data types and structures

### __Vectors__ are the primary data structures in R

\medskip

Two types of vectors:

1. __atomic vectors__
1. __lists__

\medskip

![Overview of data structures (Grolemund and Wickham, 2018)](data-structures-overview.png){width=60%}

### Review data structures: atomic vectors


\medskip An __atomic vector__ is a collection of values

- each value in an atomic vector is an __element__
- all elements within vector must have same __data type__

```{r}
(a <- c(1,2,3)) # parentheses () assign and print object in one step
length(a)
typeof(a)
str(a)
```

Can assign __names__ to vector elements, creating a __named atomic vector__

```{r}
(b <- c(v1=1,v2=2,v3=3))
length(b)
typeof(b)
str(b)
```

### Review data structures: lists

\medskip

- Like atomic vectors, __lists__ are objects that contain __elements__
- However, __data type__ can differ across elements within a list
    - an element of a list can be another list


```{r}
list_a <- list(1,2,"apple")
typeof(list_a)
length(list_a)
str(list_a)

list_b <- list(1, c("apple", "orange"), list(1, 2))
length(list_b)
str(list_b)
```

### Review data structures: lists

Like atomic vectors, elements within a list can be named, thereby creating a __named list__

```{r}
# not named
str(list_b) 

# named
list_c <- list(v1=1, v2=c("apple", "orange"), v3=list(1, 2, 3))
str(list_c) 
```

### Review data structures: a data frame is a list

A __data frame__ is a list with the following characteristics:

- All the elements must be __vectors__ with the same __length__
- Data frames are __augmented lists__ because they have additional __attributes__ [described later]

```{r}
#a regular list
list_d <- list(col_a = c(1,2,3), col_b = c(4,5,6), col_c = c(7,8,9))
typeof(list_d)
str(list_d)

#a data frame
df_a <- data.frame(col_a = c(1,2,3), col_b = c(4,5,6), col_c = c(7,8,9))
typeof(df_a)
str(df_a)
```
## Attributes and augmented vectors

### Atomic vectors versus augmented vectors

__Atomic vectors__ [our focus so far]

- I think of atomic vectors as "just the data"
- Atomic vectors are the building blocks for augmented vectors

__Augmented vectors__

- __Augmented vectors__ are atomic vectors with additional __attributes__ attached

__Attributes__

- __Attributes__ are additional "metadata" that can be attached to any object (e.g., vector or list)
- Examples of some important attributes in R:
    - __Names__: name the elements of a vector (e.g., variable names)
    - __value labels__: character labels (e.g., "Charter School") attached to numeric values
    - __Object class__: How object should be treated by object oriented programming language [discussed below]

__Main takaway__:

- Augmented vectors are atomic vectors (just the data) with additional attributes attached

### Attributes in vectors

Identify attributes in any object using the `attributes()` function

```{r}
#vector with no attributes
vector1 <- c(1,2,3,4)
vector1
attributes(vector1)

#vector with attributes
vector2 <- c(a = 1, b= 2, c= 3, d = 4)
vector2
attributes(vector2)
```


### Attributes in lists

```{r}
#no attributes
list1 <- list(c(1,2,3), c(4,5,6))
attributes(list1)

#list with attributes
list2 <- list(col_a = c(1,2,3), col_b = c(4,5,6))
str(list2)
attributes(list2)

#data frame with attributes
list3 <- data.frame(col_a = c(1,2,3), col_b = c(4,5,6))
str(list3)
attributes(list3)
```
## Object class

### Object class

\medskip 
Every object in R has a __class__

- Object class defines rules for how object can be treated by object oriented programming language (e.g., which functions you can apply to object)
- class is an __attribute__ of an object

Identify the class of an object using the `class()` function
```{r}
(vector2 <- c(a = 1, b= 2, c= 3, d = 4))
class(vector2)
```

When I encounter a new object I often investigate object by applying `typeof()`, `class()`, and `attributes()` functions to that object
```{r}
vector2
typeof(vector2)
class(vector2)
attributes(vector2)
```

### Object class

Why is __class__ important?

- Specific functions usually work with only particular __classes__ of objects
    - e.g., "date"" functions usually only work on objects with a date class
    - "string" functions usually only work with on objects with a character class
    - Functions that do mathematical computation usually work on objects with a numeric class
- Note: functions care about object __class__, not object __type__

object with `numeric` class (output omitted)
```{r, eval=FALSE}
str(wwlist)

typeof(wwlist$med_inc_zip)
class(wwlist$med_inc_zip)
sum(wwlist$med_inc_zip[1:10], na.rm = TRUE) # numeric function

# load library with date functions
library(lubridate) 
#Sys.setenv(TZ="America/Los_Angeles") #setting time zone to Los Angeles time
year(wwlist$receive_date[1:10]) # date function
```
### Object class

Why is __class__ important?

- Specific functions usually work with only particular __classes__ of objects
- Note: functions care about object __class__, not object __type__

Object with `character` class
```{r, eval=FALSE}
str(wwlist$hs_city)
typeof(wwlist$hs_city)
class(wwlist$hs_city)

tolower(wwlist$hs_city[1:10]) # string function
sum(wwlist$hs_city, na.rm = TRUE) # numeric function
```


Object with a date class
```{r, eval=FALSE}
typeof(wwlist$receive_date)
class(wwlist$receive_date)

year(wwlist$receive_date[1:10]) # date function
sum(wwlist$receive_date) # numeric function

```

### Class and object oriented programming

Definition of object oriented programming from this [LINK](https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/O/object_oriented_programming_OOP.html)

> "Object-oriented programming (OOP) refers to a type of computer programming in which programmers define not only the data type of a data structure, but also the types of operations (functions) that can be applied to the data structure."

Object __class__ is fundamental to object oriented programming because:

- object class determines which functions can be applied to the object
- object class also determines what those functions do to the object

Many different object classes exist in R

- we can also create our own classes
- but in this course we will work with classes that have been created by others

## Class == factor

### Factors

__Factors__ are an object _class_ used to display categorical data (e.g., marital status)

- A factor is an __augmented vector__ built by attaching a "levels" attribute to an (atomic) integer vectors

Usually, we would prefer a categorical variable (e.g., race, school type) to be a factor variable rather than a character variable

- So far in the course I have made all categorical variables character variables because we had not introduced factors yet

Below, I'll create a factor version of the character variable `ethn_code` 

- (don't worry about understanding this code; I'll explain it later)
```{r}
str(wwlist$ethn_code)
# create factor var; tidyverse approach
wwlist <- wwlist %>% mutate(ethn_code_fac = factor(ethn_code)) 
#wwlist$ethn_code_fac <- factor(wwlist$ethn_code) # base r approach

str(wwlist$ethn_code_fac)
```
### Factors

A factor is an __augmented vector__ built by attaching a "levels" attribute to an (atomic) integer vector

Compare (character) `ethn_code` to (factor) `ethn_code_fac` (output omitted)
```{r, results="hide"}
#character var
typeof(wwlist$ethn_code)
class(wwlist$ethn_code)
str(wwlist$ethn_code)
attributes(wwlist$ethn_code)

#factor var
typeof(wwlist$ethn_code_fac)
class(wwlist$ethn_code_fac)
str(wwlist$ethn_code_fac)
attributes(wwlist$ethn_code_fac)
```

__Main takeaway__

- `ethn_code_fac` has `type=integer` and `class=factor` because the variable has a "levels" attribute
- Underlying data are integers but levels attribute is used to display the data.
```{r}
wwlist$ethn_code_fac[1:4] # print first few obs of ethn_code_fac
```



### Working with factor variables

```{r, results='hide'}
attributes(wwlist$ethn_code_fac)
```
Refer to categories of a factor by the values of the __level attribute__ rather than the underlying values of the variable

__Task__

- count the number of prospects in object `wwlist` who identify as "white"
```{r}
# referring to variable value; this doesn't work
wwlist %>% filter(ethn_code_fac==10) %>% count 

#referring to value of level attribute; this works
wwlist %>% filter(ethn_code_fac=="white") %>% count 

```

### Working with factor variables

__Task__

- count the number of prospects in object `wwlist` who identify as "white"

If you want to refer to underlying values, then apply `as.integer()` function to the factor variable
```{r}
attributes(wwlist$ethn_code_fac)
wwlist %>% filter(as.integer(ethn_code_fac)==10) %>% count 
```
### How to identify the variable values associated with factor levels

Let's create a factor version of the character variable `psat_range`
```{r}
wwlist <- wwlist %>% mutate(psat_range_fac = factor(psat_range)) # create factor var;
```

Run below code in console rather than code chunk to see values associated with each factor
```{r, results="hide"}
wwlist %>% count(psat_range_fac)
```

Once you know values associated with factor, you can filter based on values
```{r}
wwlist %>% filter(as.integer(psat_range_fac)==4) %>% count()
```

Or you can just filter based on value of __factor levels__
```{r}
wwlist %>% filter(psat_range=="1270-1520") %>% count()
```

### Creating factor variables from character variables or from integer variables

See Appendix

### Factor student exercise   

1. After running the code below, use `typeof`, `class`, `str`, and `attributes` functions to check the new variable `receive_year`  
2. Create a factor variable from the input variable `receive_year` and name it `receive_year_fac`  
3. Run the same functions (`typeof`, `class`, etc.) from the first question using the new variable you created  
4. Get a count of `receive_year_fac`. __hint:__ you could also run this in the console to see values associated with each factor

Run this code to create a year variable from the input variable "receive_date"
```{r, results="hide", message=FALSE}
#wwlist %>% glimpse()

library(lubridate) #load library if you haven't already
wwlist <- wwlist %>%
  mutate(receive_year = year(receive_date)) #creating year variable with the lubricate package

#Check variable
wwlist %>% 
  count(receive_year)

wwlist %>%
  group_by(receive_year) %>% 
  count(receive_date)

```


### Factor student exercise solutions   
1. Use `typeof`, `class`, `str`, and `attributes` functions to check the new variable `receive_year`  
```{r}
typeof(wwlist$receive_year)
class(wwlist$receive_year)
str(wwlist$receive_year)
attributes(wwlist$receive_year) 
```

### Factor student exercise solutions  
2. Now create a factor variable from the input variable `receive_year` and name it `receive_year_fac` 
```{r}
# create factor var; tidyverse approach
wwlist <- wwlist %>%
  mutate(receive_year_fac = factor(receive_year))  

```

### Factor student exercise solutions 
3. Run the same functions (`typeof`, `class`, etc.) from the first question using the new variable you created  
```{r}
typeof(wwlist$receive_year_fac)
class(wwlist$receive_year_fac)
str(wwlist$receive_year_fac)
attributes(wwlist$receive_year_fac)   
```

### Factor student exercise solutions 
4. Get a count of `receive_year_fac`. __hint:__ you could also run this in the console to see values associated with each factor
```{r}
wwlist %>%
  count(receive_year_fac)
```


## Class == labelled

### Data we will use to introduce `labelled` class

High school longitudinal surveys from National Center for Education Statistics (NCES)

- Follow U.S. students from high school through college, labor market

We will be working with [High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09)](https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/hsls09/index.asp)

- Follows 9th graders from 2009
- Data collection waves
      - Base Year (2009)
      - First Follow-up (2012)
      - 2013 Update (2013)
      - High School Transcripts (2013-2014)
      - Second Follow-up (2016)    

### `haven` package

[`haven`](https://haven.tidyverse.org/), which is part of __tidyverse__, "enables R to read and write various data formats" from the following statistical packages: 

- SAS
- SPSS
- Stata

When using `haven` to read data, resulting R objects have these characteristics:

- Are __tibbles__, a particular type of data frame we discuss future weeks
- Transform variables with "value labels" into the `labelled()` class [our focus today]
    - `labelled` is an object __class__ created by folks who created `haven` package
    - `labelled` is an object class, just like `factor` is an object class
    - `labelled` and `factor` classes are both viable alternatives for categorical variables
    - Helpful description of `labelled` class  [HERE](https://haven.tidyverse.org/articles/semantics.html)
- Dates and times converted to R date/time classes
- Character vectors not converted to factors

### `haven` package

Use `read_dta()` function from `haven` to import Stata dataset into R
```{r, results="hide"}
hsls <- read_dta(file="https://github.com/ozanj/rclass/raw/master/data/hsls/hsls_stu_small.dta")
```

Let's examine the data
```{r, results="hide"}
names(hsls)
names(hsls) <- tolower(names(hsls)) # convert names to lowercase
names(hsls)

str(hsls) # ugh

str(hsls$s3classes)
attributes(hsls$s3classes)
typeof(hsls$s3classes)
class(hsls$s3classes)
```

### `labelled` package

Purpose of the `labelled` package is to work with data imported from SPSS/Stata/SAS using the `haven` package. 

- In particular, `labelled` package creates functions to work with objects that have `labelled` class
- From package documentation: "purpose of the `labelled` package is to provide functions to manipulate _metadata_ as variable labels, value labels and defined missing values using the `labelled` class and the `label` attribute introduced in `haven` package.
- More info on the `labelled` package: [LINK](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/labelled/vignettes/intro_labelled.html)

Functions in `labelled` package

- [Full list](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/labelled/versions/1.1.0)
- A couple relevant functions
    - `val_labels`: get or set variable _value labels_
    - `var_label`: get or set a _variable label_

```{r, results="hide"}
attributes(hsls$s3classes)

hsls %>% select(s3classes) %>% var_label
hsls %>% select(s3classes) %>% val_labels
```
### Core concepts for understanding `labelled` class [SKIP]

__atomic vectors (and lists)__ the underlying data

- data structures: vector or list
- data type: numeric (integer or double); character; logical
```{r}
typeof(hsls$s3classes)
```

__augmented vectors__ are atomic vectors with __attributes__ attached

__attributes__ are "metadata" attached to an object. Examples

- __names__: names of elements of a vector or list (e.g., variable names)
- __levels__: display output associated with values of a factor variable
- __class__: e.g., factor, labelled

```{r, results="hide"}
attributes(hsls$s3classes)
```
__class__ is an object oriented programming concept. The `class` of an object determines which functions can be applied to the object and what those functions do

- e.g., can't apply `sum()` to an object where `class=character`

### What is `labelled` class?

\medskip

- `labelled` is an object class created by the `haven` package for importing variables from SAS/SPSS/Stata that have __value labels__
- __value labels__ [in Stata] are labels attached to specific values of a variable:
    - e.g., variable value `1` attached to value label "married", `2`="single", `3`="divorced"
- Variables in an R data frame with `class==labelled`:
    - data `type` can be numeric(double) or character
    - To see `value labels` associated with each value:
        - `attr(data_frame_name$variable_name,"labels")`
        - e.g., `attr(hsls$s3classes,"labels")`

Let's investigate the attributes of `hsls$s3classes`
```{r, results="hide"}
typeof(hsls$s3classes)
class(hsls$s3classes)
str(hsls$s3classes)
attributes(hsls$s3classes)
```
use `attr(object_name,"attribute_name")` to refer to each attribute
```{r, results="hide"}
attr(hsls$s3classes,"label")
attr(hsls$s3classes,"labels")
attr(hsls$s3classes,"class")
attr(hsls$s3classes,"format.stata")
```

### Working with `labelled` class data

\medskip

Show variable labels (`var_label`); and show value labels (`val_labels`)
```{r, results="hide"}
hsls %>% select(s3classes,s3clglvl) %>% var_label #show variable label
hsls %>% select(s3classes,s3clglvl) %>% val_labels #show value labels
```

Create frequency tables with `labelled` class variables using `count()`

- Default setting is to show variable __values__ not __value labels__
```{r, results="hide"}
hsls %>% count(s3classes)
#investigate the object created
hsls_freq_temp <- hsls %>% count(s3classes)
hsls_freq_temp
rm(hsls_freq_temp)
```

To make frequency table show __value labels__ add `%>% as_factor()` to pipe

- `as_factor()` is function from `haven` that converts an object to a factor
```{r, results="hide"}
hsls %>% count(s3classes) %>% as_factor()
#investigate the object created
hsls_freq_temp <- hsls %>% count(s3classes)  %>% as_factor()
hsls_freq_temp
rm(hsls_freq_temp)
```
### Working with `labelled` class data

To isolate values of `labelled` class variables in `filter()` function:

- refer to variable __value__, not the __value label__

__Task__ 

- how many observations in var `s3classes` associated with "Unit non-response"
- how many observations in var `s3classes` associated with "Yes"

General steps to follow: 

1. investigate object
1. use filter to isolate desired observations

Investigate object
```{r, results="hide"}
class(hsls$s3classes)
hsls %>% select(s3classes,s3clglvl) %>% var_label #show variable label
hsls %>% count(s3classes) # freq table, values
hsls %>% count(s3classes) %>% as_factor() # freq table, value labels
```

filter specific values
```{r, results="hide"}
hsls %>% filter(s3classes==-8) %>% count() # -8 = unit non-response
hsls %>% filter(s3classes==1) %>% count() # 1 = yes
```

### Labelled student exercise

1. Get variable and value labels of `s3hs`  
2. Get a count of the variable showing the values and the value labels. __hint__ use factor()  
3. Filter if value is associated with "Missing"  
4. Filter if value is associated with "Missing" or "Unit non-response"

### Labelled student exercise solutions
1. Get variable and value labels of `s3hs` 
```{r}
hsls %>% 
  select(s3hs) %>% 
  var_label() 

hsls %>% 
  select(s3hs) %>% 
  val_labels()
```

### Labelled student exercise solutions
2. Get a count of the variable `s3hs` showing the value labels. __hint__ use factor()

```{r}
hsls %>% 
  count(s3hs) 

hsls %>% 
  count(s3hs) %>% 
  as_factor() 

```

### Labelled student exercise solutions
3. Filter if value is associated with "Missing"
```{r}
hsls %>%
  filter(s3hs== -9) %>% 
  count()
```

### Labelled student exercise solutions  
4. Filter if value is associated with "Missing" or "Unit non-response"
```{r}
hsls %>%
  filter(s3hs== -9 | s3hs== -8) %>% 
  count()
```


## Comparing labelled class to factor class

### Comparing `class==labelled` to `class==factor`

|  | `class==labelled` | `class==factor`
|---|----------|-------------|
| data type  |    numeric or character   | integer |
| name of value label attribute | labels | levels |
| refer to data using | variable values | levels attribute |

    
### Converting `class==labelled` to `class==factor`

The `as_factor()` function from `haven` package converts variables with `class==labelled` to `class==factor`

- Can be used for descriptive statistics
```{r, results="hide"}
hsls %>% select(s3classes) %>% count(s3classes) %>% as_factor()
```

- Can create object with some or all `labelled` vars converted to `factor`
```{r}
hsls_f <- as_factor(hsls,only_labelled = TRUE)
```

Let's examine this object
```{r, results="hide"}
glimpse(hsls_f)
hsls_f %>% select(s3classes,s3clglvl) %>% str()
typeof(hsls_f$s3classes)
class(hsls_f$s3classes)
attributes(hsls_f$s3classes)

hsls_f %>% select(s3classes) %>% var_label()
hsls_f %>% select(s3classes) %>% val_labels()
```

### Working with `class==factor` data

Showing values associated with factor levels
```{r}
hsls_f %>% count(s3classes)
```

In code, refer `level` attribute not variable value
```{r}
hsls_f %>% filter(s3classes=="Yes") %>% count(s3classes)
```



# Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

## Tools for EDA

### What is exploratory data analysis (EDA)?

The [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/exploratory-data-analysis-8fc1cb20fd15) website has a nice definition of EDA:

> "Exploratory Data Analysis refers to the critical process of performing initial investigations on data so as to discover patterns,to spot anomalies,to test hypothesis and to check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations." 

This course focuses on "data management": 

- investigating and cleaning data for the purpose of creating analysis variables
- Basically, everything that happens before you conduct analyses

I think about "Exploratory data analysis for data quality"

- Investigating values and patterns of variables from "input data"
- Identifying and cleaning errors or values that need to be changed
- Creating analysis variables
- Checking values of analysis variables agains values of input variables

### Tools of EDA

To do EDA for data quality, must master the following tools:

- \medskip Select, sort, filter, and print
    - Select and sort particular values of particular variables
    - Print particular values of particular variables
- One-way descriptive analyses (i.e,. focus on one variable)
    - Descriptive analyses for continuous variables
    - Descriptive analyses for discreet/categorical variables
- Two-way descriptive analyses (relationship between two variables)
    - Categorical by categorical
    - Categorical by continuous
    - Continuous by continuous

Whenever using any of these tools, __pay close attention to missing values and how they are coded__

I'll focus on the __tidyverse__ approach rather than __base R__

### Tools of EDA

First, Let's create a smaller version of the HSLS:09 dataset
```{r}
#hsls %>% var_label()
hsls_small <- hsls %>%
  select(stu_id,x3univ1,x3sqstat,x4univ1,x4sqstat,s3classes,
         s3work,s3focus,s3clgft,s3workft,s3clgid,s3clgcntrl,
         s3clglvl,s3clgsel,s3clgstate,s3proglevel,x4evrappclg,
         x4evratndclg,x4atndclg16fb,x4ps1sector,x4ps1level,
         x4ps1ctrl,x4ps1select,x4refsector,x4reflevel,x4refctrl,
         x4refselect, x2sex,x2race,x2paredu,x2txmtscor,x4x2ses,x4x2sesq5)
```

### Tools of EDA: select, sort, filter, and print

We've already know `select()`, `arrange()`, `filter()` 

\medskip Select, sort, and print specific vars
```{r, results="hide"}
hsls_small %>% arrange(desc(stu_id)) %>% 
  select(stu_id,x3univ1,x3sqstat,s3classes,s3clglvl)

#print value labels
hsls_small %>% arrange(desc(stu_id)) %>% 
  select(stu_id,x3univ1,x3sqstat,s3classes,s3clglvl) %>% as_factor()
```
Sometimes helpful to increase the number of observations printed
```{r, results="hide"}
class(hsls_small) #it's a tibble
options(tibble.print_min=50) 
# execute this in console
hsls_small %>% arrange(desc(stu_id)) %>%
  select(stu_id,x3univ1,x3sqstat,s3classes,s3clglvl)
options(tibble.print_min=10) # set default printing back to 10 lines
```

### One-way descriptive stats for continuous vars, Base R approach [SKIP]

```{r, results="hide"}
mean(hsls_small$x2txmtscor)
sd(hsls_small$x2txmtscor)

#Careful: summary stats include value of -8!
min(hsls_small$x2txmtscor)
max(hsls_small$x2txmtscor)
```
Be careful with `NA` values
```{r, results="hide"}
#Create variable replacing -8 with NA
hsls_small_temp <- hsls_small %>% 
  mutate(x2txmtscorv2=ifelse(x2txmtscor==-8,NA,x2txmtscor))
hsls_small_temp %>% filter(is.na(x2txmtscorv2)) %>% count(x2txmtscorv2)

mean(hsls_small_temp$x2txmtscorv2)
mean(hsls_small_temp$x2txmtscorv2, na.rm=TRUE)
rm(hsls_small_temp)
```
### One-way descriptive stats for continuous vars, Tidyverse approach

Use `summarise_at()` which is a variation of `summarise()` to calculate descriptive stats

- explain `.args=list(na.rm=TRUE)` on next slide

```{r, results}
#?summarise_at
hsls_small %>% 
  summarise_at(
    .vars = vars(x2txmtscor),
    .funs = funs(mean, sd, min, max, .args=list(na.rm=TRUE))
  )
```

### One-way descriptive stats for continuous vars, Tidyverse approach

"Input vars" in survey data often have negative values for missing/skips

- R includes those negative values when calculating statistics, which you probably don't want

Solution: create version of variable that replaces negative values with NAs
```{r}
hsls_small %>% mutate(x2txmtscor_na=ifelse(x2txmtscor<0,NA,x2txmtscor)) %>%
  summarise_at(
    .vars = vars(x2txmtscor_na),
    .funs = funs(mean, sd, min, max, .args=list(na.rm=TRUE))
  )
```
What if you didn't include `.args=list(na.rm=TRUE)`?
```{r}
hsls_small %>% mutate(x2txmtscor_na=ifelse(x2txmtscor<0,NA,x2txmtscor)) %>%
  summarise_at(
    .vars = vars(x2txmtscor_na),
    .funs = funs(mean, sd, min, max)
  )
```


### One-way descriptive stats for continuous vars, Tidyverse approach

How to identify these missing/skip values if you don't have a codebook?

`count()` combined with `filter()` helpful for finding extreme values of continuous vars, which are often associated with missing or skip

```{r}
hsls_small %>% filter(x2txmtscor<0) %>% 
  count(x2txmtscor)

hsls_small %>% filter(s3clglvl<0) %>%
  count(s3clglvl)
```

### One-way descriptive stats student exercise

1. Using the object `hsls`, check the variable and value labels of `x4ps1start`  
2. Get a frequency count of the variable `x4ps1start`  
3. Get a frequency count of the variable, but this time checking for negative values __hint__: use filter()  
4. Create a new version of the variable `x4ps1start_na` that replaces negative values with NAs and use `summarise_at()` to get the min and max value.  
**Note**: This variable is a bit counterintuitive.

### One-way descriptive stats student exercise solutions

  val_labels()
```

```

### One-way descriptive stats student exercise solutions
4. Create a new version `x4ps1start_na` of the variable `x4ps1start` that replaces negative values with NAs and use `summarise_at()` to get the min and max value.

  summarise_at(
    .vars = vars(x4ps1start_na),
    .funs = funs(min, max, .args=list(na.rm=TRUE))
  )
```

### One-way descriptive stats for discrete/categorical vars, Tidyverse approach

Use `count()` to investigate values of discreet or categorical variables

For variables where `class==labelled`
```{r, results="hide"}
class(hsls_small$s3classes)
#show counts of variable values
hsls_small %>% count(s3classes)
#show counts of value labels
hsls_small %>% count(s3classes) %>% as_factor()
```

- I like `count()` because the default setting is to show `NA` values too!
```{r, results="hide"}
hsls_small %>% mutate(s3classes_na=ifelse(s3classes<0,NA,s3classes)) %>% 
  count(s3classes_na)
```

Show both values and value labels on count tables for `class==labelled`
```{r, results="hide"}
#CRYSTAL'S SOLUTION
x <- hsls_small %>% count(s3classes)
y <- hsls_small %>% count(s3classes) %>% as_factor()
bind_cols(x[,1], y)
```

### One-way descriptive stats for discrete/categorical vars, Tidyverse approach

For variables where `class==factor` 
[PROBLEM: HOW TO RETAIN FACTOR LEVELS AFTER MUTATE]
```{r, results="hide"}
#use variable from the hsls data frame where vars are factors
class(hsls_f$s3classes)
attributes(hsls_f$s3classes)

#show frequency table
hsls_f %>% count(s3classes)
#frequency table with NAs
  #note: within ifelse() used levels(s3classes)[s3classes]) rather than s3classes  to show attribute levels not values
hsls_f %>% mutate(s3classes_f=ifelse(s3classes %in% c("Missing","Unit non-response"),NA,levels(s3classes)[s3classes])) %>% 
  count(s3classes_f)
```


### Relationship between variables, categorical by categorical

Two-way frequency table, sometimes called "Cross tabulation", is important for checking data quality  
- When you create categorical analysis var from single categorical "input" var  
    - Two-way tables show us whether we did this correctly  
- Two-way tables helpful for understanding skip patterns in surveys

Task: Create a two-way table between `s3classes` and `s3clglvl`
```{r, results="hide"}
hsls_small %>% select(s3classes,s3clglvl) %>% var_label()

hsls_small %>% group_by(s3classes) %>% count(s3clglvl)
hsls_small %>% group_by(s3classes) %>% count(s3clglvl) %>% as_factor()
```
What if one of the variables has `NAs`?

- Table created by `group_by()` and `count()` shows `NAs`!
```{r, results="hide"}
hsls_small %>% select(s3classes,s3clglvl) %>%
  mutate(s3classes_na=ifelse(s3classes<0,NA,s3classes)) %>%
  group_by(s3classes_na) %>% count(s3clglvl)

hsls_small %>% select(s3classes,s3clglvl) %>%
  mutate(s3classes_na=ifelse(s3classes<0,NA,s3classes),
         s3clglvl_na=ifelse(s3clglvl==-7,NA,s3clglvl)) %>%
  group_by(s3classes_na) %>% count(s3clglvl_na)
```
### Relationship between variables, categorical by categorical

Tables above are pretty ugly

Use the `spread()` function from `tidyr` package to create table with one variable as columns and the other variable as rows

- The variable you place in `spread()` will be columns

```{r, results="hide"}
hsls_small %>% group_by(s3classes) %>% count(s3clglvl) %>% 
  spread(s3classes, n)

hsls_small %>% group_by(s3classes) %>% count(s3clglvl) %>% 
  as_factor() %>%  spread(s3classes, n)
hsls_small %>% group_by(s3classes) %>% count(s3clglvl) %>% 
  as_factor() %>%  spread(s3clglvl, n)
```

### Relationship between variables, categorical by continuous

Investigating relationship between multiple variables is a little tougher when at least one of the variables is continuous

One approach is the __conditional mean__:

- Shows average values of continous variables within groups
- Groups are defined by your categorical variable(s)

Relationship to regression

- Conditional mean is similar to regression with a continuous dependent variable and a categorical X variable

Task: 

- Investigate the relationship between math test score, `x2txmtscor`, and parental education, `x2paredu`

```{r, results="hide"}
#first, investigate parental education
hsls_small %>% count(x2paredu)
hsls_small %>% count(x2paredu) %>% as_factor

## using dplyr to get average math score by parental education level
hsls_small %>%
    group_by(x2paredu) %>%
    summarise_at(.vars = vars(x2txmtscor),
                 .funs = funs(mean, .args = list(na.rm = TRUE))) %>%
    as_factor()
```

### Relationship between variables, categorical by continuous

Task: Investigate the relationship between math test score, `x2txmtscor`, and parental education, `x2paredu`

For checking data quality, helpful to calculate other stats besides mean
```{r, results="hide"}
hsls_small %>% group_by(x2paredu) %>%
    summarise_at(.vars = vars(x2txmtscor),
                 .funs = funs(mean, min, max, .args = list(na.rm = TRUE))) %>%
    as_factor()

```
Always Investigate presence of missing/skip values
```{r, results="hide"}
hsls_small %>% filter(x2paredu<0) %>% count(x2paredu)
hsls_small %>% filter(x2txmtscor<0) %>% count(x2txmtscor)
```

Replace `-8` with `NA` and re-calculate conditional stats
```{r, results="hide"}
hsls_small %>% select(x2paredu,x2txmtscor) %>%
  mutate(x2paredu_na=ifelse(x2paredu<0,NA,x2paredu),
         x2txmtscor_na=ifelse(x2txmtscor<0,NA,x2txmtscor)) %>% 
  group_by(x2paredu_na) %>%
  summarise_at(.vars = vars(x2txmtscor_na),
               .funs = funs(mean, min, max, .args = list(na.rm = TRUE))) %>%
  as_factor()
```
### Student exercise

Can use same approach to calculate conditional mean by multiple `group_by()` variables

- Just add additional variables within `group_by()`

1. Calculate mean math test score (`x2txmtscor`), for each combination of parental education (`x2paredu`) and sex (`x2sex`).  


### Student exercise solution  
1. Calculate mean math test score (`x2txmtscor`), for each combination of parental education (`x2paredu`) and sex (`x2sex`)
```{r, results="hide"}
#hsls_small %>% 
#  count(x2sex)

hsls_small %>%
  group_by(x2paredu,x2sex) %>%
  summarise_at(.vars = vars(x2txmtscor),
               .funs = funs(mean, .args = list(na.rm = TRUE))) %>%
  as_factor()
```

## Guidelines for EDA

### Guidelines for "EDA for data quality"

Assme that your goal in "EDA for data quality" is to investigate "input" data sources and create "analysis variables"

- Usually, your analysis dataset will incorporate multiple sources of input data, including data you collect (primary data) and/or data collected by others (secondary data)

While this is not a linear process, these are the broad steps I follow 

1. Understand how input data sources were created
    - e.g., when working with survey data, have survey questionnaire and codebooks on hand
1. For each input data source, identify the "unit of analysis" and which combination of variables uniquely identify observations
1. Investigate patterns in input variables
1. Create analysis variable from input variable(s)
1. Verify that analysis variable is created correctly through descriptive statistics that compare values of input variable(s) against values of the analysis variable

__Always be aware of missing values__

### "Unit of analysis" and which variables uniquely identify observations

"Unit of analysis" refers to "what does each observation represent" in an input data source

- If each obs represents a student, you have "student level data"
- If each obs represents a student-course, you have "student-course level data"
- If each obs represents a school, you have "school-level data"
- If each obs represents a school-year, you have "school-year level data"

How to identify unit of analysis

- data documentation
- investigating the data set

### "Unit of analysis" and which variables uniquely identify observations

Identify the variable -- or group of vars -- that "uniquely identifies" observations

- "uniquely identifies observations": each value of the var has a frequency count of `1`

This is important for many data management tasks

- e.g., merging data sources, "tidying" data

How to identify which variable(s) uniquely identify observations

- data documentation
- investigating the data set

```{r}
hsls_small %>% group_by(stu_id) %>% # group_by our candidate
  mutate(n_per_id=n()) %>% # calculate number of obs per group
  ungroup() %>% # ungroup the data
  count(n_per_id==1) # count "true that only one obs per group"


#hsls_small %>% count(stu_id) %>% filter(n> 1) ## Patricia's approach
#Karina approaches using assertthat package
#library(assertthat)
#stopifnot(length(unique(uga_pub$ncessch))==nrow(uga_pub))
#assert_that(any(duplicated(uga_pub, by=c("ncessch", "var2")))==FALSE)
```

### Rules for variable creation

Rules I follow for variable creation

1. \medskip Never modify "input variable"; instead create new variable based on input variable(s)
    - Always keep input variables used to create new variables
1. Investigate input variable(s) and relationship between input variables
1. Developing a plan for creation of analysis variable
    - e.g., for each possible value of input variables, what should value of analysis variable be?
1. Write code to create analysis variable
1. Run descriptive checks to verify new variables are constructed correctly
    - Can "comment out" these checks, but don't delete them
1. Document new variables with notes and labels

### Rules for variable creation

Task: Create analysis for ses qunitile called `sesq5` based on `x4x2sesq5`

```{r, results="hide"}
#investigate input variable
hsls_small %>% select(x4x2sesq5) %>% var_label()
hsls_small %>% select(x4x2sesq5) %>% val_labels()
hsls_small %>% select(x4x2sesq5) %>% count(x4x2sesq5)
hsls_small %>% select(x4x2sesq5) %>% count(x4x2sesq5) %>% as_factor()

#create analysis variable
hsls_small_temp <- hsls_small %>% 
  mutate(sesq5=ifelse(x4x2sesq5==-8,NA,x4x2sesq5)) # approach 1
hsls_small_temp <- hsls_small %>% 
  mutate(sesq5=ifelse(x4x2sesq5<0,NA,x4x2sesq5)) # approach 2

#verify
hsls_small_temp %>% group_by(x4x2sesq5) %>% count(sesq5)
```
## Skip patterns in survey data

### What are skip patterns

Pretty easy to create an analysis variable based on a single input variable

Harder to create analysis variables based on multiple input variables

- When working with survey data, even seemingly simple analysis variables require multiple input variables due to "skip patterns"

What are "skip patterns"? 

- [?DELETE OR DELAY?] Response on a particular survey item determines whether respondent answers some set of subsequent questions
- What are some examples of this?

Key to working with skip patterns

- Have the survey questionnaire on hand
- Sometimes it appears that analysis variable requires only one input variable, but really depends on several input variables because of skip patterns
    - Don't just blindly turn "missing" and "skips" from survey data to `NAs` in your analysis variable
    - Rather, trace why these "missing" and "skips" appear and decide how they should be coded in your analysis variable


### Creating analysis variables in the presence of skip patterns

Task: Create a measure  of "level" of postsecondary institution attended in 2013 from HSLS:09 survey data

- "level" is highest award-level of the postsecondary institution
    - e.g., if highest award is associate's degree (a two-year degree), then `level==2'
- The measure, `pselev2013`, should have following [non-missing] values:
    1. Not attending postsecondary education institution
    2. Attending a 2-year or less-than-2-year institution
    3. Attending 4-year or greater-than-4year institution

Background info:

- In "2013 Update" of HSLS:09, students asked about college attendance
    - Variables from student responses to "2013 Update" have prefix `s3`
- Survey questionnaire for 2013 update can be found [HERE](https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/hsls09/pdf/2013_Student_Parent_Questionnaire.pdf)
- The "online codebook" website [HERE](https://nces.ed.gov/onlinecodebook) has info about specific variables
- Measure has 3 input variables [usually must figure this out yourself]:
    1. `x3sqstat`: "X3 Student questionnaire status"
    1. `s3classes`: "S3 B01A Taking postsecondary classes as of Nov 1 2013"
    1. `s3clglvl`: "S3 Enrolled college IPEDS level"

```{r, results="hide"}
hsls_small %>% select(x3sqstat,s3classes,s3clglvl) %>% var_label()
```
You won't have time to complete this task, but develop a plan for the task and get as far as you can

### Creating analysis variables in the presence of skip patterns

Step 1a: Investigate each input variable separately
```{r, results="hide"}
#variable labels
hsls_small %>% select(x3sqstat,s3classes,s3clglvl) %>% var_label()

hsls_small %>% count(x3sqstat)
hsls_small %>% count(x3sqstat) %>% as_factor()

hsls_small %>% count(s3classes)
hsls_small %>% count(s3classes) %>% as_factor()

hsls_small %>% count(s3clglvl)
hsls_small %>% count(s3clglvl) %>% as_factor()

```
### Creating analysis variables in the presence of skip patterns

Step 1b: Investigate relationship between input variables
```{r, results="hide"}
#x3sqstate and s3classes
hsls_small %>% group_by(x3sqstat) %>% count(s3classes) 
hsls_small %>% group_by(x3sqstat) %>% count(s3classes) %>% as_factor()

hsls_small %>% filter(x3sqstat==8) %>% count(s3classes)
hsls_small %>% filter(x3sqstat==8) %>% count(s3classes==-8)
hsls_small %>% filter(x3sqstat !=8) %>% count(s3classes)

#x3sqstate, s3classes and s3clglvl
hsls_small %>% group_by(s3classes) %>% count(s3clglvl) 
hsls_small %>% group_by(s3classes) %>% count(s3clglvl) %>% as_factor()

#add filter for whether student did not respond to X3 questionnaire
hsls_small %>% filter(x3sqstat==8) %>% group_by(s3classes) %>% count(s3clglvl) 
hsls_small %>% filter(x3sqstat !=8) %>% group_by(s3classes) %>% count(s3clglvl)

#continued on the next page
```


### Creating analysis variables in the presence of skip patterns

Step 1b: Investigate relationship between input variables continued...
```{r}
#add filter for s3classes is "missing" [-9]
hsls_small %>% filter(x3sqstat !=8,s3classes==-9) %>% group_by(s3classes) %>%
  count(s3clglvl)
hsls_small %>% filter(x3sqstat !=8,s3classes!=-9) %>% group_by(s3classes) %>%
  count(s3clglvl)

#add filter for s3classes equal to "no" or "don't know"
hsls_small %>% filter(x3sqstat !=8,s3classes!=-9, s3classes %in% c(2,3)) %>%
  group_by(s3classes) %>% count(s3clglvl)
hsls_small %>% filter(x3sqstat !=8,s3classes!=-9, s3classes %in% c(2,3)) %>% 
  group_by(s3classes) %>% count(s3clglvl) %>% as_factor()

hsls_small %>% filter(x3sqstat !=8,s3classes!=-9, s3classes==1) %>% 
  group_by(s3classes) %>% count(s3clglvl)
hsls_small %>% filter(x3sqstat !=8,s3classes!=-9, s3classes==1) %>% 
  group_by(s3classes) %>% count(s3clglvl) %>% as_factor()
```

Assignment: create GPA variables from student-course level data

- Link to assignment HERE

Data source: [National Longitudinal Study of 1972 (NLS72)](https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/nls72/)

- Follows 12th graders from 1972
- Data collection waves
    - Base year: 1972
    - Follow-up surveys in:  1973, 1974, 1976, 1979, 1986
    - Postsecondary transcripts collected in 1984
- Why use such an old survey for this assignment?
    - NLS72 predates data privacy agreements so postsecondary transcript data are publicly available
    
```{r}
#LOAD DATA
```
Work on the following in your homework groups:

- Read assignment
- Conduct EDA investigations of input data
    - For homework assignment, you only need to focus on these variables [and can ignore the others]
- Develop a plan for how you will go about creating GPA variables

# Appendix. Creating factor variables

### Create factors [from string variables]

To create a factor variable from string variable

1. create a character vector containing underlying data
1. create a vector containing valid levels
3. Attach levels to the data using the `factor()` function

```{r}
#underlying data: months my fam is born
x1 <- c("Jan", "Aug", "Apr", "Mar")
#create vector with valid levels
month_levels <- c("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", 
  "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec")
#attach levels to data
x2 <- factor(x1, levels = month_levels)
```
Note how attributes differ
```{r}
str(x1)
str(x2)
```
Sorting differs
```{r}
sort(x1)
sort(x2)
```

### Create factors [from string variables]

Let's create a character version of variable `hs_state` and then turn it into a factor

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#wwlist %>%
#  count(hs_state)
#Subset obs to West Coast states 
wwlist_temp <- wwlist %>%
  filter(hs_state %in% c("CA", "OR", "WA"))

#Create character version of high school state for West Coast states only
wwlist_temp$hs_state_char <- as.character(wwlist_temp$hs_state)

#investigate character variable
str(wwlist_temp$hs_state_char)
table(wwlist_temp$hs_state_char)

#create new variable that assigns levels
wwlist_temp$hs_state_fac <- factor(wwlist_temp$hs_state_char, levels = c("CA","OR","WA"))
str(wwlist_temp$hs_state_fac)

#wwlist_temp %>%
#  count(hs_state_fac)
rm(wwlist_temp)

```

### Create factors [from string variables]
How the `levels` argument works when underlying data is character

- Matches value of underlying data to value of the level attribute
- Converts underlying data to integer, with level attribute attached

\medskip See chapter 15 of Wickham for more on factors (e.g., modifying factor order, modifying factor levels)

### Creating factors [from integer vectors]

Factors are just integer vectors with level attributes attached to them. So, to create a factor:

1. create a vector for the underlying data
1. create a vector that has level attributes
3. Attach levels to the data using the `factor()` function

```{r}
a1 <- c(1,1,1,0,1,1,0) #a vector of data
a2 <- c("zero","one") #a vector of labels

#attach labels to values
a3 <- factor(a1, labels = a2)
a3
str(a3)

```

Note: By default, `factor()` function attached "zero" to the lowest value of vector `a1` because "zero" was the first element of vector `a2`

### Creating factors [from integer vectors]

Let's turn an integer variable into a factor variable in the `wwlist` data frame

Create integer version of `receive_year`
```{r}
#typeof(wwlist_temp$receive_year)
wwlist$receive_year_int <- as.integer(wwlist$receive_year)
str(wwlist$receive_year_int)
typeof(wwlist$receive_year_int)

```


Assign levels to values of integer variable
```{r, eval=FALSE}
wwlist$receive_year_fac <- factor(wwlist$receive_year_int, labels=c("Twenty-sixteen","Twenty-seventeen","Twenty-eighteen"))
str(wwlist$receive_year_fac)
str(wwlist$receive_year)

#Check variable
wwlist %>%
  count(receive_year_fac)

wwlist %>%
  count(receive_year)
```
